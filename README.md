Golang library for MySQL database automation

## Features

Most of Go La Tengo's current functionality is focused on MySQL schema introspection and diff'ing. Future releases will add more general-purpose automation features.

### Schema introspection

Go La Tengo examines several `information_schema` tables in order to build Go struct values representing schemas (databases), tables, columns, indexes, foreign key constraints, stored procedures, and functions. These values can be diff'ed to generate corresponding DDL statements.

### Instance modeling

The `tengo.Instance` struct models a single database instance. It keeps track of multiple, separate connection pools for using different default schema and session settings. This helps to avoid problems with Go's database/sql methods, which are incompatible with USE statements and SET SESSION statements.

## Status

This is package is intended for production use. The release numbering is still pre-1.0 though as the API is subject to minor changes. Backwards-incompatible changes are generally avoided whenever possible, but no guarantees are made yet.

### Supported databases

Tagged releases are tested against the following databases, all running on Linux:

* MySQL 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 8.0
* Percona Server 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 8.0
* MariaDB 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5

Outside of a tagged release, every commit to the main branch is automatically tested against MySQL 5.7 and 8.0.

### Unsupported in table diffs

Go La Tengo **cannot** diff tables containing any of the following MySQL features yet:

* spatial indexes
* sub-partitioning (two levels of partitioning in the same table)
* special features of non-InnoDB storage engines

This list is not necessarily exhaustive. Some of these may be implemented in subsequent releases.

Go La Tengo also does not yet support rename operations, e.g. column renames or table renames.

### Ignored object types

The following object types are completely ignored by this package. Their presence won't break anything, but they will not be introspected or represented by the structs in this package.

* views
* triggers
* events
* grants / users / roles
